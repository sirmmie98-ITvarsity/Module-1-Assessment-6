        <p>Shower Power by Ampere is an award-winning waterproof speaker that generates 100% of its power from water, so you can listen to your favorite music, podcasts and audiobooks in the bathroom. Designed to fit any showerhead, it's also made from 100% recycled ocean plastic.
        We're listening to more content at home than ever before. If you're like us, you've got music and podcasts streaming at all hours. But there's one place in the house that's tough to get good sound — the shower. Existing waterproof speakers just don't cut it. So, we made a speaker that you'll love using in the shower, every day.</p>
